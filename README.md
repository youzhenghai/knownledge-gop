# knownledge-gop

The code runs on Kaldi-5.5 and primarily utilizes computer-gop.

Once you have prepared the data, you simply need to back up "kaldi/egs/gop_speechocean" and use this project to overwrite it. Then, run "aug_run.sh" to proceed.

The data will be stored in a separate repository.

The code implements random data augment SVM, knowledge data augment SVM, and compares their plotting with GOP.
